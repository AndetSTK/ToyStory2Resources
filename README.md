# Toy Story 2 Resources

This repository contains various resources for Toy Story 2 reverse engineering/speedrunning.

Feel free to fork/contribute if desired.

## Autosplitter

The source for the autosplitter used by [livesplit](http://livesplit.org/) is contained in the [AutoSplitter](AutoSplitter) folder.

The autosplitter currently works on PC US and PC UK versions as well as Project64 1.7.0.50 Ver.23.

I know that PJ64 is oddly specific (and old), but that's the version of project64 that best emulates Toy Story 2, and is the version used to speedrun the game.

## Cheat Engine

There are currently 2 cheat tables for the PC US version of the game in [CheatEngine](CheatEngine).

`toy2base` simply contains some addresses for common useful things in the game.

`toy2trainer` contains the forms and addresses for the [trainer](https://www.speedrun.com/toys2/thread/n8y8a) which contains some useful tools for practicing various things within the game.

## Project 64

The [Project64](Project64) folder contains some additional cheats for the US N64 ROM of the game to be added to (or simply replace) the Project64.cht file for the emulator running the game.
